This project was created to learn how to use the terminal and node js to automatically create a Read.Me without having to type everything out every single time. This can also be used for future projects when needed.
This Read.Me generator is here to save valuable time enhanciong your focus on your code and development instead of having to worry so much on what will need to be added into your Read.Me.
